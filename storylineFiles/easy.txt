[][Its a cold, rainy day as you trudge along the trenches along side your officer. All of a sudden, a loud boom goes off in the distance. Startled, you and your comrades jump onto the ledge to see over the trenches, and see several enemy soldiers charging at you.][1, 2, 3]
[Turn around and flee]["Coward!" Your officer shouts in anger, "You'll be shot for this!" He raised his pistol, and before you knew it you were shot dead.][]
[Start shooting at the enemy][You raised your rifle, and began shooting at the enemy. Wave after wave of enemy soldiers, shrouded in mist, charged towards you but you kept on firing. Countless number of shots later, you reached into your pocket, only to find your ammo bag empty.][4, 5]
[Freeze in fear][You get shot immediately, and dies (why did you even choose this?)][]
[Inform your officer] [You informed your officer that you're out of ammunition. "Then go to that machine gun nest over there! They need some help!" You turned and looked to see that 50 yards away rests a machine gun nest, with the body of two of your comrades on top of it, clearly taken out by a sniper. You know for sure that if you were to get on the machine gun nest, you'd likely get shot.][8, 9]
[Start throwing grenades][You tossed a few grenades, and they exploded in front of the enemies. However, more enemies kept coming and you're beginning to get overran. Your officer orders you to be the rearguard and cover everyone elses retreat, but you're likely to die in that case.][6, 7]
[Cover everyone elses retreat as ordered][With bullets flying around you, you sprint through the narrow trench lines that leads back to the second line trenches, firing back occasionally as you do so. Panic gripped you the whole time as you know that if you're to be injured, no one will save you. But you miraculously make it back to the safety of the second line, and you survive another day.][]
[Ignore his order and flee with the others][Fleeing with the others in a chaotic stampede, you manage to arrive at the back lines safely under the din of your own artillery fire. Furious that you disobeyed his orders, your officer berates you for being a coward and shoots you on the spot.][]
[Runs to the machine gun nest to take over it as ordered][On your way there, a shell suddenly whizzles overhead. Glancing frantically around you, you couldn't find any cover. Before you knew it, you were blown to pieces.][]
[Pretend to run to the machine gun nest, but dive into a bunker when no one's looking.][You ran to the machine gun nest, but quickly dives into a bunker when nobody is looking. Hiding behing a table, you remained as quietly as you can as you hear enemy soldiers overrun your trench. You then hear footsteps, and 2 enemy soldiers enter the bunker you're hiding in and spot you immediately. Not wanting to die, you allow them to take you prisoner.][]
